		<p> Ever since I was little I liked to take things after my dad, for an example, he played football so I got into it. He works at Edison, a company that fixes the powerlines and other electrical services. He works in Huntington Beach and his hours are from 6AM-4PM. You are paid off of how many hours you work. You can go in after 4PM and get paid more by the hour. They roughly make around $300,000 a year. </p>
		<h2>How To Become A Trouleman And A Lineman</h2>
<p>To become a lineman, you would need to go to trade school for 6 months, then apply for the job. You then become a groundman for 6 months. From there, you would become an apprentice lineman for 3 years. Then you are a Journeyman lineman.

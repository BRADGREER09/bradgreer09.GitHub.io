		<p>I loved to surf ever since I was little, and its always been an interest to me. My favorite surfing brand is Bilabong, it originated in Australia in 1973.I have surfed in Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, and Manly, Australia. My favorite place to go is Huntingon because the vibe is really chill. I am soon getting a new board for my 15th birthday.</p>

			<p> I have played baseball ever since I was 4 years old. I started at East Long Beach Pony Baseball until I was 8, but I moved to Heartwell and stayed there. I still play for Heartwell  Baseball, and enjoy all the games and tournaments. I am going to try out for the Lakewood baseball team during my freshman year of highschool.</p>

		<p>When I was at Pony Baseabll, the year I went to Heartwell my dad put me in BMX. BMX is when you race bikes on a track. I have won many races and when I was in 3rd grade I quit BMX to be apart of a team and play football. I raced at Bellflower BMX and I have been offered to get sponsored but decided to quit before I accpeted. I've also competed at Orange country and won there too.</p>

		<p>Ever since I was born we have traveled a ton. I have been to Australia, and the entire west coast of America. We've camped the entire west coast of America, and got a fridge magnet for every state we went to. My sister also went to Europe and got a magnet, and so did I when I went to Australia. My favorite place to go is Hawaii because I love the beaches and the fun things to do. The first time I went was when I was in 3rd grade and went to an Island called "Ohau". I plan to continue to travel to many differnet places.</p>

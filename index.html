		<p>I loved to surf ever since I was little, and its always been an interest to me. My favorite surfing brand is Bilabong, it originated in Australia in 1973.I have surfed in Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, and Manly, Australia. My favorite place to go is Huntingon, and I am soon getting a new board for my 15th birthday.</p>

			<p> I have played baseball ever since I was 4 years old. I started at East Long Beach Pony Baseball until I was 8, but I moved to Heartwell and stayed there. I still play for Heartwell  Baseball, and enjoy all the games and tournaments. I am going to try out for the Lakewood baseball team during my freshman year of highschool.</p>

		<p>When I was at Pony Baseabll, the year I went to Heartwell my dad put me in BMX. BMX is when you race bikes on a track. I have won many races and when I was in 3rd grade I quit BMX to be apart of a team and play football. I raced at Bellflower BMX and I have been offered to get sponsored but decided to quit before I accpeted. I've also competed at Orange country and won there too.</p>

		alt="Opera House" widht="400" height="600"> </center> Ever since I was little I have been traveling. I had traveled the entire west coast of America and some other states. I've been to Australia, and I loved my trip to Australia. My grandmother, two cousins, and myself went on the trip. My two cousins live in Arkansas and to start the trip we met half way to meet each other to fly straight to Australia. We met in Fort Worth, Dallas to meet my two cousins Andy and Emma. We flew to Sydney, Australia and from there to Cairns. We went to an animal sanctuary, leanred aboriginal cultures, and finally snorkeld at the Great Barrier Reef. After we visited Cairns, we went to a place in the outback called Uluru. We saw Ayers Rock, and from there flew to Sydney for the last part of our trip. We went to another animal sanctuary, saw the Sydney Opera House, took a tour on the tallest building in Sydney, and finally went surfing. I love traveling so much and camping too,I plan to continue to travel to many differnet places.</p>
